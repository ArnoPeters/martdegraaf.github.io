This year I read and listened to 'Eat that frog!' by Brian Tracy. I tried to apply these principles to my daily life.

## Summary

Eat that frog is a practical book on how to "get more of the important things done today".

## Comparing Agile and the lecture in Eat that frog

I see many aspects that are similar in working Agile as what is stated in 'Eat that frog'. For example:

1. Focus on key result areas (The work in the sprint)
1. Use the ABCDE Method Continually (The Product owner should keep the backlog up to date)
1. Prepare thoroughly before you begin (refinements)
1. Slice and Dice the Tasks (The division of Epic Feature and Product backlog, and task level)
1. Develop a sense of urgency (The sprint is time-boxed)

## Lessons learned as a developer

Think about your daily, weekly, monthly, and long-term goals.
Make sure you check your daily goals with your long-term goals.

### Example long-term goals

1. Getting certified
1. Become a public speaker
1. Get healthier and lighter

## Recommendations

I recommend reading or listening to this book and practicing some of the given habits. One that will highly depend on the individual is: 'Upgrade your key skills'. I think you should be making goals to keep learning next to your daily work. Sometimes even before doing any daily work. The learning will increase your efficiency especially when you focus on a key skill.
